## MVP Development Plan: Meeting Summarizer & Action Item Extractor

### Ì∫Ä **Overview**
A streamlined application leveraging AI to transcribe meetings, summarize conversations, and extract clear action items.

### ÌæØ **Goal of MVP**
- Validate core functionality: transcription, summarization, and extraction of action items.
- Ensure ease of use with minimal initial overhead (manual recording uploads).

---

### Ì∑© **Core Features**
1. **Audio Upload**: Users upload meeting recordings (MP3/WAV).
2. **Speech-to-Text**: Automatic transcription using OpenAI Whisper.
3. **AI Summarization & Extraction**:
   - Concise meeting summary.
   - Clearly identified action items, deadlines, responsible individuals.
4. **Simple Web Interface**: Basic frontend for user interactions and displaying summaries.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Technology Stack**

- **Backend:**
  - Python (FastAPI or Flask)
  - OpenAI APIs:
    - Whisper (audio-to-text transcription)
    - GPT (summarization and action-item extraction)

- **Frontend**:
  - Simple HTML/CSS, minimal JavaScript (basic upload and summary display)

- **Deployment**:
  - Local deployment initially; future AWS/Azure/Google Cloud consideration

### Ì¥ß **MVP Technical Workflow**

1. **User Action**:
   - Upload audio file via web interface.

2. **Backend Processing**:
   1. Transcribe using Whisper:
      ```python
      audio_file = open("meeting_audio.mp3", "rb")
      transcript = openai.Audio.transcribe("whisper-1", audio_file)
      ```

   2. Summarize transcript & extract action items using GPT:
      ```markdown
      Prompt example:
      "Summarize this meeting clearly, listing any action items, deadlines, and responsible people explicitly."
      ```

### Ìª†Ô∏è **Development Steps**

- **Step 1 (Core functionality)**:
  - Set up FastAPI or Flask backend.
  - Integrate Whisper transcription.
  - Basic GPT summarization & extraction of action items.

- **Step 2 (Frontend)**:
  - Basic web interface for uploading files and displaying summaries.

### Ìºü **Future Expansion (beyond MVP)**
- Automatic integration plugins (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams)
- Automated email distribution of meeting notes
- Slack and project management software integrations
- Cloud storage for summaries and recordings

### Ì≥Ö **Timeline**
- MVP development estimated: 2-4 weeks (prototype-ready)
- Expanded features integrated incrementally based on feedback
